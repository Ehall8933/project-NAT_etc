# project-NAT_etc
This project is a **Cisco Packet Tracer lab** that demonstrates a small enterprise-style network with VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and multiple services hosted on a server. It is designed as a learning project for practicing routing, switching, and network services.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Start the simulation and verify DHCP leases for laptops and PCs.
3. Test connectivity:
   - `ping` across VLANs
   - Web browsing to the server
   - FTP/Email services
4. Observe NAT translation when reaching external networks.
